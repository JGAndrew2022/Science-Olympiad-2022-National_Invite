# Science-Olympiad-2022-National_Invite

**Competition Details**

a. Participants aim to predict labels from features using a computational model. Tasks, provided by the
Event Supervisor, will consist of a Training Dataset and a Test Dataset. The Training Dataset consists
of features and labels, while the Test Dataset only contains features. The performance of each model
will be evaluated based on a given metric using an unknown subset of the Test Dataset.
b. The Event Supervisor must release the Task at least two weeks prior to the competition. Online
submissions, through Kaggle Classroom, are accepted until the start of the Tournamentâ€™s first event.
c. Tasks are limited to the following categories: binary or multi-class classification, two-dimensional object
detection, and regression of a single variable.
d. Participants must run their code in a Kaggle Kernel to generate a formatted CSV file and submit the CSV
to the Kaggle competition. The Kernel must be published and shared with the Event Supervisor.

I placed 2nd overall in the event, Kaggle results can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/soni2022/leaderboard
